* distance stem:[\delta(d_i)] -- minimum number of transitions connecting d0 with d
* stratum Di -- set of d : stem:[\delta(d)] = i
* set of states D partiotioned into finite set of strata stem:[D_0, D_1, ... D_k]
* B - bud stack
* Bud{d, l,setN} -- partically ordered by distance

Algorithm updates stratum top-down. Processing stratum called *front*, their distance - front distance.

Prefix -- set of processed strata, fixed. 

Front: states are fixed, change only transition function

Suffix: not processing yet, states can change (extension and transition function). Can perform distance relocation if one of B stack is empty. For that using relocation sequence R.
