= MFA 
A mutating finite automaton (MFA) is a nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA) that changes its morphology over discrete time by a sequence of mutations.

*MFA* can be represented by a sequence of NFAs, where each mutated NFA $N_{i+1}$, i â‰¥ 0, results from the application of a mutation to $N_i$.

A *mutation* is a set of update actions on $N_i$:

* insertions of states/transitions -- incremental mutations
* removals of states/transitions -- decremental mutations (Lamperti G, Zhao X. Decremental subset construction)

 Subset Construction determinization algorithm 
 Subset Restructuring, which, instead of constructing the new DFA from scratch based on the mutated NFA, generates the new DFA by updating the previous DFA based on the mutation occurred

== Determinization algorithm 
At [1] authors introduce MFA throw determinization algorithm

== Subset Construction 
A Subset Construction determinization algorithm it's a classical algorithm

=== Temporal determinization problem
