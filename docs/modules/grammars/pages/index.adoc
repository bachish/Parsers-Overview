= Grammars 

== BNF 
 https://condor.depaul.edu/ichu/csc447/notes/wk3/BNF.pdf

* `::=` means "is defined as" (some variants use `:=` instead)
* `|` means `or`
* Angle brackets mean a nonterminal
* Symbols without angle brackets are terminals

Example 

```
<number> ::= <digit> | <number> <digit>
<digit> ::= 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9
```

== EBNF 
BNF with some extensions (they vary, but often are derived from
regular expression syntax):

* `*` (The Kleene Star): means 0 or more
occurrences
* `+` (The Kleene Cross): means 1 or more
occurrences
* `?` means 0 or 1 occurrences (sometimes
`[ â€¦ ]` used instead)
* Use of parentheses for grouping





== PEG -- Parsing Expression Grammars

 Ford, Bryan (January 2004). "Parsing Expression Grammars: A Recognition Based Syntactic Foundation" [https://bford.info/pub/lang/peg.pdf]

 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar

Syntactically, PEGs also look similar to context-free grammars (CFGs), but they have a different interpretation: the choice operator selects the first match in PEG, while it is ambiguous in CFG.

Unlike CFGs, PEGs cannot be ambiguous; a string has exactly one valid parse tree or none. t is conjectured that there exist context-free languages that cannot be recognized by a PEG, but this is not yet proven. 

 So PEG is a subsequence of CFG?
